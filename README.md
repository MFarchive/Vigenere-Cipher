# Vigenere-Cipher
Python and R code for solving the Vigenere Cipher with the Twist Algorithm, Twist+ Algorithm and Kasiski Examination


This document contains code used to implement the Twist+ and Twist Algorithms, which are used to find the key length of a Vigenere cipher.
Also included is an implementation of the Kasiski Analysis, which is also used to find the key length for the Vigenere cipher.
Letter frequency analysis is used to decipher the encoded text once the key length has been determined
